Hi

I would like to note few things:

1) I create a html file that contains my dask usage when running feature_prep.py.
The purpose of this is to give you a better sense (more info) when my code is executed in a multi-processed fashion.
Because of this reason, the file is equivalent to the screen shot you asked for.

** Update: Nevertheless I ran my code again and added the screen shot of dask UI in case you need that for grading **

2) You can see the bucket name in S3 bucket screen shot. 

3) Make sure you set up the environment using .ec2_initialization.sh first. 
I will use some of the external pacakges when running feature_prep.py and final_module.py

4) Before you run my feature_prep.py, make sure you have prepared the data first. "2009q1" is what you need.
Thus, I strongly recommend you read my code first if you run into any trouble. 

5) For label generation part, please modify the URL in which you can get access to the data. 
The original data source in my s3 bucket is deleted since it is not required to submit. 
Remember to prepared the data.

6) In final_module.py we fit the model and get a score which evaluates the model.

7) My code works perfectly fine when we run the code, so if you have any questions regarding the execution of our code
or any trouble related to it, please contact me anytime time you want. I will try my best to resolve the issue for you.
